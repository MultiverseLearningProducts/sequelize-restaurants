# sequelize-restaurants

Let's take our restaurant database and use [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), a JavaScript ORM, to interact with it.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository or [download a copy](https://github.com/MultiverseLearningProducts/sequelize-restaurants/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Run the tests by running `npm test`.
